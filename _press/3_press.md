title: Stellar Dust Survey Paves Way for Exoplanet Missions
description: >
  Veils of dust wrapped around distant stars could make it difficult to image potentially habitable planets in those star systems. The Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems, or HOSTS, survey was tasked with learning more about the effect of dust on the search for new worlds. The goal is to help guide the design of future planet-hunting missions. In a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal, we have reported on the survey’s initial findings. Using the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer, or LBTI, on Mount Graham in Arizona, the HOSTS survey determines the brightness of warm dust floating in the orbital planes of other stars (called exozodiacal dust). In particular, HOSTS has studied dust in nearby stars’ habitable zones, where liquid water could exist on the surface of a planet. The LBTI is five to 10 times more sensitive than the previous telescope capable of detecting exozodiacal dust, the Keck Interferometer Nuller. Among the findings detailed in the new paper, we report that a majority of Sun-like stars do not possess high levels of dust -- good news for future efforts to study potentially-habitable planets around those stars.
