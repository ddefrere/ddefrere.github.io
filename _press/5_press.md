title: Scientists caught a new planet forming for the first time ever
description: >
  For the first time, we have observed a planet being formed and have captured images of dust and gas particles accumulating together 
  to make a protoplanet in a distant solar system. The phenomenon was observed in the solar system surrounding a star called LkCa 15, located 
  450 light-years away from Earth. Catching a planet in the making is an exciting first because, of the nearly 3500 exoplanets weâ€™ve so far
  identified, none are in the process of formation. Observations like these are crucial to test planet formation theories and improve our
  understanding of planet formation, which is still uncertain today.
