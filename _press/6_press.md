title: An image of a whole planetary system
description: >
  Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity of the Large Binocular Telescope in southeastern Arizona, we have obtained the first results from the LEECH exoplanets survey. The findings reveal new insights into the architecture of HR8799,
  a "scaled-up" version of our solar system 130 light-years from Earth. We have probed deeper than before into a planetary system 130 light-years from Earth. The observations mark the first results of a new exoplanet survey called LEECH 
  (LBT Exozodi Exoplanet Common Hunt).  The planetary system of HR8799, a young star only 30 million years old, was the first to be directly imaged, with three planets found in in 2008 and a fourth one in 2010.
