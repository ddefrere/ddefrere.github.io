<img src="/assets/img/logos/kul.png" alt="inline_image" style="float: left; height: 1.8lh; margin-right: 1ex; margin-top: .1lh" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"> I am an astronomy professor and researcher at the <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster"> Institute of Astronomy </a> of <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/"> KU Leuven </a> in Belgium, where I work towards finding scientific answers to some of the most intriguing questions about our universe. I was previously a Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/2169/en"> Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy </a> (2010-2012), <a href="https://www.arizona.edu"> the University Arizona </a> (2012-2026), and <a href="https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_8699436/en/uliege"> University of Liège </a>(2016-2020), both within the <a href="https://www.psilab.uliege.be/cms/c_9965343/en/psilab?id=c_9965343"> PSILab </a> group and the <a href="https://www.csl.uliege.be/cms/c_10241774/en/csl?id=c_10241774"> Liege Space Center</a>

My scientific interests focus on developing and deploying cutting-edge instruments to directly detect and analyse exoplanets, particularly Earth-like worlds orbiting nearby stars. I am currently been deeply involved in the <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/"> European Southern Observatory (ESO) </a> instrumentation programs. He is currently the principal investigator of the <img src="/assets/img/logos/erc.png" alt="inline_image" style="height: 1lh;" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"> ERC-funded SCIFY project, which is building <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/research-projects/nott/nott-asgard/"> Asgard/NOTT</a>, a new high-contrast instrument for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at Cerro Paranal in Chile. I also participate in the development and scientific exploitation of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/gravityplus"> GRAVITY+ </a> on the VLTI and am a science team member of <a target="_blank" href="https://metis.strw.leidenuniv.nl">METIS</a>, a future infrared imager on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). I was previoulsy Instrument scientist of the <a href="https://nexsci.caltech.edu/missions/LBTI/"> Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer </a>, a NASA nulling interferometer located in the Arizona desert.

In parallel, I currently serve as Belgium’s representative on the <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/committees/uc/uc2025.html"> ESO User Committee</a>, where I work to ensure the scientific community’s needs are reflected in ESO’s operations and strategic planning. I also coordinate the <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/projects/belgian-vlti-expertise-centre"> Belgian VLTI expertise center </a> and the VLTI joint research activities within the Horizon 2020-funded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.orp-h2020.eu"> Opticon RadioNet Pilot </a> (ORP) project, leading efforts to improve access to and user support for the VLTI.

In additoin to my research activities, I currently teach two classes on <a target="_blank" href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/G0I52AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp1983744"> Planetary Systems </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/G0P40AN.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp1493952"> Observational Techniques in Astronomy </a>.
